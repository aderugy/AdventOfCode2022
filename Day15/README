Part I (2022-12-20):
Thought about creating a 2D array representing the map (with not much hope)
Tried instantiating a 1M * 1M char matrix -> out of memory (expected)
Tried again with a same size bool matrix -> out of memory (expected)
At least I tried!

Part II (same day):
Very, very, very, very (very?) tough problem.
At first, I tried to calculate [0; 4000000] was included in the intersection of the boundaries of each of the sensors for every row.
After failing a few other attempts, I had to search a bit on the Internet about it, and found the maths behind it.
I probably wouldn't have solved it without...
