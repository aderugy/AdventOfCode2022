Part I (completed on 2022-12-21):
It was a really fun problem!
I really like my solution, I believe it is one of the most optimized that could have been done.

The way it works is simple:
I separate every monkey in two categories: known and unknown
If a monkey relies on another to calculate it's value, I will store it in a map
Then, for every known monkey, I update all of the monkeys that rely on it, and add them to the queue of known ones if possible.


Part II:
I really enjoyed solving this one aswell.
I don't think I could've done much better for this one as well.
The process is simple:
It computes the computes the equation the other way around, using the values we already know from part 1, until it finds 'humn'.
