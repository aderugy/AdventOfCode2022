Part I (completed on 2022-12-20):
I actually struggled a lot on this one.
Not because it was complicated.
I didn't understand that there could actually be '10' as a packet value...
Lost like 3 hours coding it again and again and debugging..
But then it went smoothly, simple recursion.

Part II (completed on same day):
This one was very easy.
Just had to implement a really really basic (and not the best) sorting algorithm.
