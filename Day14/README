Part I completed on 2022-12-19
Was kind of easy, I guess the tricky part was to manage the data, but the Split method made it easy.

Part II (same day):
Was more challenging, had to adapt the width of the board in function of the height.
To do so, I guessed that a sand unit couldn't go further to the left or to the right than the max value of Y.
I then put a margin on the X axis.
The logical part was the same.
